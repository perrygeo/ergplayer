What are .erg files
********************
Erg files define a cycling workout by prescribing precise power outputs over time.

Why use ergplayer
*****************
 Using a true ergometer, the machine can force a rider to work at a given level. But if you're on your road bike (equiped with a power meter) on rollers or an indoor trainer, you may want to use the same workouts. 

This little program will display the workout info as you go. But it's up to you to check with you power meter and make sure you're following along!
