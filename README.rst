Erg files define a cycling workout by prescribing precise power outputs over time. It is a simple text file format commonly
used by the popular `Computrainer`_. You can find a couple of examples in the `test_data`_ directory of this project. 

There are also several other web resources for downloading or creating .erg workout files, the best of which is the `ErgDB`_ which
allows you to search a library of existing workouts, import workouts and adjust them to your fitness level. 

Why use ergplayer
*****************
Using an ergometer like the Computrainer, the machine can force a rider to work at a given level. 
But if you're on your road bike (equiped with a power meter) on rollers or an indoor trainer, 
you may want to follow along the same workouts. 

This little program will not replace an ergometer/computrainer! It will just display the workout info as you go. 
But it's up to you to check with your power meter and make sure you're following along!
